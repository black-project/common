Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Common is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "black/common": "@stable"
    }
}
```

__Protip:__ You should browse the [`black/common`](https://packagist.org/packages/black/common) page to choose a stable version to use, avoid the `@stable` meta
constraint.

Usage
-----
Common is quite simple, there is only an abstract class for Doctrine Manager with simple methods and three specifications (and/or/not).
